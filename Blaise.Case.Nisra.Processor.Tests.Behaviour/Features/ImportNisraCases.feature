	In order to process cases gathered online
	As a service
	I want to be given cases to import representing the data captured online

#Covers all scenarios in one test run
Scenario: There is an online file available that contains cases that already exists in the blaise database, the cases are updated depending on the outcome codes
	Given there is a Nisra file that contains the following cases
	| primarykey | outcome | mode | 
	#scenario 1
	| 900001     | 110     | Web  | 
	#scenario 2
	| 900002     | 210     | Web  |
